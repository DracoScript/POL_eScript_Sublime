# POL_eScript_Sublime
Syntax Highlighting for Sublime-Text 3 with POL eScript based on POLeScriptNPP (for Notepad++) https://forums.polserver.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5536&amp;p=22571#p21891.

# Installing
To use this syntax highlight on Sublime-Text 3 you must locate your ??/Sublime-Text-3/Packages/ folder and place the .sublime-syntax files inside, usually in the Users folder.
Now when opening .src, .inc and .cfg file they may be pointed to the corresponding POL eScript syntax. If not, you must check your bottom right corner of the sublime window and select from the list (check inside the User or the name of the folder you placed the files within Packages folder).
I used it in a different folder inside Packages folder, named POLServer so I can find both syntaxes inside a submenu named POLServer within the syntax list. ??/Sublime-Text-3/Packages/POLServer/*everything cloned from this git
