Syntax Highlighting for Sublime-Text 3 with POL eScript based on POLeScriptNPP (for Notepad++) https://forums.polserver.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5536&amp;p=22571#p21891

To use this syntax highlight on Sublime-Text 3 you must locate your ??/Package/ folder and place the .sublime-syntax inside, usually in the Users folder.
Now when opening .scp, .inc and .cfg file they may be pointed to the POL eScript syntax (check bottom right corner of Sublime-Text 3 window)
